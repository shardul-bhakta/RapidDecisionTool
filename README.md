# RapidDecisionTool
My thesis project of my Master's from San Diego Sate university. This tool is a GIS Software to predict earthquakes destruction in Sumatra by using First Motion Study.

Rapid Decision Tool helps geologists or scientists to input earthquake data points of an earthquake which has just been detected. The tool scans the history data set and shows you similar earthquakes in the past. After analyzing the pattern of earthquake history, you can predict how fatal the detected earthquake can be. Saving minutes, or even seconds in notifying emergency response teams in areas of probable damage can be very significant. 

Rapid Decision Tool has enough intelligence to parse and collect data sets through the history of earthquakes and make a decision about the real time earthquake in question. This map based tool helps you to navigate through the position of real time earthquake with
respect to positions of similar earthquakes on the map of Indonesia. The Rapid Decision Tool displays different colors depicting real time earthquakes and similar earthquakes distinctly to create a clear understanding of comparisons with magnitudes and depths.

With future development of this tool by scaling it globally, I hope its use is justified in prediction of earthquakes and help save lives in Sumatra.

This tool has been developed in JAVA. I have used MOJO (Map Objects JAVA Objects) to show map of Indonesia and earthquake locations in the form of points. ESRI has created MOJO which is a set of JAVA API's.

GIS technologies used: Map Objects-JAVA edition, and j2sdk were used along with the Eclipse IDE to develop this tool.
